Our role is to increase the capacity of a local organization, Save the Rhino Trust (SRT), to help them protect the largest and expanding free-ranging population of black rhino in the world. By protecting the black rhino meta poplation in the Kunene region of NW namibia we will ensure that ecosystem services are functing for people and nature. There are 15 community wildlife conservancies in this 15-million-acre protected area that includes 2 national parks and 3 people's parks. SRT needs to change it's business model from straight protection with their own scouts to a skill transfer service organization building protection and monitoring capacity of the 15 communal conservancies in the region. This transformation requires some organizational restructuring, increased fundraising capacity and an incentive program for community game guards. This is the only way that communities will be able to monitor, protect and benefit from wildlife on these communal lands. SRT fills a critical vaccum here and so TNC's value add is to bring technical and financial support to SRT to ensure the national CBNRM program in Namibia is based on sound land use zoning and wildlife management. If lands are managed well, pastoralism is compatible with wildlife conservation. The widespread nature of pastoralism across eastern, southern and western Africa provides ample opportunity for replicating this approach beyond northern Namibia. Grasslands and arid lands are among the most highly threatened and least conserved habitat types in the world, and our work in Africa has great potential to ease those threats. We are already connecting our projects in Namibia and northern Kenya.","StartDate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","EndDate":null,"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null,"Status":"Idea","Accomplishments":[

Primeiras and Segundas (site scale): Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in Africa: 90 percent of the population lives on less than US $2/day, life expectancy is 43 years, and 12.5 percent of the population is HIV/AIDS positive. In northern coastal Mozambique's Zambezi and Nampula provinces, the country's poorest, we are partnering with WWF, CARE and local fishing communities to help create a new 4.2\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmillion-acre protected area in the Primeiras and Segundas (P&S) Archipelago that aims to protect biodiversity and improve the livelihoods of local people. The Conservancy's coral reef resiliency science and experience designing and implementing marine protected areas in the Pacific and Mexico complement the work of WWF and CARE to improve the viability and sustainability of a new marine protected area. West Indian Ocean EBA Partnership (regional scale): The Western Indian Ocean Partnership (WIOP) is an initiative that aims to promote national and regional commitments and actions at the highest levels to safeguard the resilience of the region's ecosystems so these can continue to provide benefits for sustainable livelihoods, address climate change impacts needs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly adaptation-, and secure human security in the region.

The essential elements \u2013 information, technologies and practices, clear government regulation, and motivated companies, producers and consumers \u2013 exist or are in the works. A key gap is ac- cess to funding to help producers cover the upfront costs of transitioning to sustainable intensification tech- nologies and practices. The next step is to pull the disparate pieces together on specific landscapes and sea- scapes to demonstrate the business case for replication. What is the LACC\u2019s opportunity? Within the LACC, we have a unique gathering of leading food-supply play- ers in industry, government and lending institutions. We propose to harness this asset to create collabora- tions to implement the LACC\u2019s vision.","StartDate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","EndDate":null,"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null,"Status":"Idea","Accomplishments":[

It is a mosaic of conserved and connected private, communal and public lands that protect unique habitats, wildlife and fresh water across latitudinal and elevation gradients that help ensure resiliency to climate change while sustaining pastoral communities. The project area includes private land conservation, 19 community wildlife conservancies with more coming every year, a water fund, a critical partnership with Kenya Wildlife Service and national land and wildlife policy influence. Our vision for Northern Kenya is to increase the resiliency and improve the balance between pastoralists and wildlife by improving rangeland condition and strengthening local governance. Devolving resource management to the local level will help ensure ownership and proper management for current and future generations.

Much remains as it was millennia ago, a fact to be rejoiced. But population growth and changes in climate have altered Africa's landscapes over the past 50 years. With increasingly complex challenges comes the need for evolved conservation strategies. The Nature Conservancy's vision for Africa is rooted in its people, who have not always been at the table when creating a plan for a sustainable future. Roughly 60% of Africa's lands and nearly 100% of Africa's waters are community property - shared resources that sustain iconic wildlife and some of the most vulnerable people on Earth. Conservation success in Africa will not happen without the involvement of local communities. It is these communal lands and waters outside of Africa's famed national parks that are critical to the continent's wildlife and people as the majority of the wildlife live or migrate outside of national park boundaries. Our projects in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Gabon, Namibia and the West Indian Ocean focus on helping local communities, governments and organizations better manage important shared assets. Mostly this is about bringing benefit to local communities who live with wildlife but see no benefit. We realize that local communities need to own and get dividends from these critical resources. Conservation has to pay to be successful.","StartDate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","EndDate":null,"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null,"Status":"Idea","Accomplishments":[

      "ProjectId":46,"Name":"Zambia","BriefDescription":"Improve management on public and community lands within the 16-million-acre Kafue ecosystem; and, provide leaders with proven tools to avoid, reduce or mitigate development impacts and secure fresh water in the Kafue River Basin for people, nature and industry.","LongDescription":"The Kafue Ecosystem in western Zambia is a 16.7 million acre complex of intact woodland and seasonally flooded grasslands that is dominated by the Kafue River and its tributaries. This system is dominated by Kafue National Park - a 5.5 million acre government managed protected area. Surrounding the Park are nine community managed areas called Game Management Areas (GMAs) that span an additional 11.2 million acres. This vast, unfenced system harbors two-thirds of Zambia's natural habitat types, including healthy examples of Miombo, Mopane and riparian woodland, deciduous teak forest, extensive floodplains, Papyrus swamp and flooded grasslands. These habitats support a magnificent range of wildlife including 158 mammal, 481 bird, 69 reptile, 36 amphibian and 58 fish species. This system includes much of the Kafue River catchment, the largest tributary to the Zambezi River and the drinking water source for the 2.5 million people living in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. Additionally the Kafue River provides fish for people to eat, water for irrigation and floodplain farming.   Like so many places in the world, pressure on this system is increasing. The most direct threats to wildlife in the unfenced Kafue National Park (KNP) are unmanaged wildfire and rampant poaching. As a result, wildlife abundance in KNP has been degraded since the mid 1970s. Due to the relatively low wildlife numbers, tourism volumes have decreased reducing revenue for proper Park management. As a result, Park infrastructure needs rehabilitation and resource management is drastically insufficient.   The source of poaching and wildfire pressure comes from the communities living in the GMAs outside the park boundaries. These communities do not see sufficient benefit from protecting wildlife and their traditional lifestyle is marginalized by the Park. The Government has created mechanisms for trophy hunting fees to flow back to Community Resource Boards in each GMA but funds rarely flow due to lack of transparency and declining revenues being generated by safari hunting. We refer to this current unfortunate situation as ?aborted devolution? ? meaning that the intent of devolving resource management locally and sharing hunting revenue with communities was good, but it is not working effectively and communities, most hunting operators and the Zambian government are currently reviewing alternative devolved resource management strategy options.  The Nature Conservancy believes that local resource management when rewarded with a tangible stream of benefits is the most effective and sustainable conservation strategy. Our approach in the Kafue Ecosystem is to make community conservation successful by rebuilding the traditional authority, increasing strong local governance, diversifying and increasing revenue from improved resource management and job creation and by working in partnership with the Government. If communities see benefit and are encouraged to manage resources, pressure on wildlife will decrease and abundance will be restored over time.  The key strategy therefore, is to focus on creating a transparent and sustainable management system for the community lands around the park. This system will improve support to and acceptance of conservation activities on their lands by communities through the transparent and equitable distribution of revenues generated by community management of natural resources in community lands adjacent to the National Park by the people who are critical stewards of freshwater and terrestrial biological diversity and abundance. A successful model can be replicated and scaled across the Zambezi River Basin.","StartDate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","EndDate":null,"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null,"Status":"Idea","Accomplishments":[

      "ProjectId":1745,"Name":"Kentucky Green Heart Project","BriefDescription":"The Louisville Green Heart Project seeks to test the hypothesis that exposure to neighborhood greenspace diminishes cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by decreasing the levels of air pollution. This study will provide much-needed quantitative data on how urban greenspaces impact health.","LongDescription":"The Louisville Green Heart Project\r\nFull Project Description\r\n\r\nProblem:  Data show that Louisville neighborhoods adversely impacted by a sparse tree canopy, higher temperatures (urban heat island hot spots), and a variety of environmental justice issues, are also neighborhoods where residents have poor health outcomes. Previous research has demonstrated that air pollution increases rates and severity of heart disease, obesity and diabetes and that the neighborhoods with poor air quality coincide with areas of elevated health risks.  Louisville routinely leads the region in poor air quality and has high rates of asthma and cardiovascular disease (CVD).   These health problems place a large burden on city residents, especially those that are economically disadvantaged, and cost hundreds of millions of dollars ($650 million annually for CVD alone). \r\n\r\nOpportunities:  Pioneering work at the University of Louisville suggests that residential proximity to major roadways and exposure to particulate air pollution are associated with chronic cardiovascular injury.  Additional work in this field has suggested that areas with high levels of greenness (trees, shrubs, and other dense vegetation) are likely to experience improved cardiovascular health, better health outcomes, and reduced hospital admissions. It thus appears possible that increasing the greenness of an area through targeted tree and vegetated buffer plantings may lead to reductions in ambient air pollution and other environmental factors that contribute to poor health. \r\n\r\nTaken together, the scientific evidence suggests that increasing trees, vegetation, and overall green space within cities will improve citizen health. Pulmonary, metabolic and cardiovascular disease are among the leading causes of death in Louisville and therefore a decrease in the incidence, prevalence and severity of these diseases achieved through a decrease in air pollution is likely to yield significant health cost savings.  Importantly, this view also illuminates potential new opportunities to account for health cost savings as a possible mechanisms to fund large scale greening required to address Louisville\u2019s and other cities increasing urban heat island effects, poor air quality, and other environmental challenges. We believe that robust quantification of avoided healthcare costs resulting from such health improvements could pave the way to ultimately establish a viable and scalable funding stream to implement neighborhood greening programs.\r\n   \r\n\r\nOur vision: Despite the demonstrated link between air quality and health impacts, and the link between a lack of trees, vegetation and decreases in air quality, there is surprisingly little quantitative data demonstrated that more vegetation leads directly to better health outcomes.   The Louisville Green Heart project seeks to test whether such a direct link is there and can be effectively measured and quantified.  In other words, we will use science to demonstrate whether we can improve health outcomes through the implementation of a neighborhood-scale greening plan.  More broadly speaking, we seek to reduce health inequities in Louisville and demonstrate the role nature can play to significantly improve human health and other measures of community wellness.   Ultimately, this project seeks to test the benefits nature can deliver to address Louisville\u2019s current environmental realities and their immediate health impact by improving the city\u2019s long-term resiliency.  More specifically, the Green Heart project seeks to answer the following key questions:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCan nature filter and reduce the availability of damaging fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from neighborhoods effectively to improve CVD outcomes?\r\n\u2022\tWhich suite of vegetation, species, densities and proximities are best for the job?\r\n\u2022\tHow does the presence/absence of nature affect novel biomarkers of subclinical cardiovascular injury such as circulating stem cells, plasma thrombotic response, and inflammation to evaluate the mechanisms underlying CVD risk?  \r\n\u2022\tWhat does greening a neighborhood effectively cost? Can we reduce the healthcare cost (e.g., the rates of hospital admissions and the length of stay) for CVD by using nature-based planning tools, thus, demonstrating a return on investment (ROI)? \r\n\u2022\tCan we determine how increasing greenspace affects other critical measures of neighborhood health (crime, educational performance, etc)?\r\n\u2022\tCould this project result in private sector healthcare policy outcomes that place emphasis on investing in nature as preventative medicine, thus injecting additional capital for nature?\r\n\r\nOutput: A neighborhood scaled greening project, a rigorous study and report that could be disseminated in print or electronic form. The Conservancy anticipates the report will have the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) as a key collaborating institution.  The report would focus on air pollution and CVD, but has the potential for sub-studies around social measures, real-time asthma monitoring, or other co-benefits from nature. \r\n\r\nAudience:  International agencies (e.g., WHO), national agencies (e.g., EPA, NIEHS, USFS), healthcare industry, urban planners, city officials, philanthropists, and community leaders.  Ultimately, we aim to spur the development of new public health policies that incentivize the use of nature to achieve better health outcomes and the formation of model approaches that could be readily transported to other cities in both developing and developed countries.  \r\n \r\nChallenges:  While it is currently unclear to what extent geographic, urban and ecologic features of Louisville are related to poor health outcomes, it is clear that solutions to our local problems will have to come from both public and private interests and are likely to extend across all land use types: residential, commercial, industrial and institutional. Therefore it is essential to fully engage each of these sectors to help inform and drive the development of our proposed community engagement efforts. Extensive community engagement is vital to development of the greening plan and implementation of that plan in the selected neighborhoods.   We are already reaching out to faith-based communities, neighborhood groups, and organizations that specialize in meaningful and successful engagement with diverse constituencies, and we will work with all these entities as the project continues to move forward. \r\n\r\nWhat is transformational:  Successful completion of this project will lead to a rigorous evaluation of the link between urban vegetation and greenspace with cardiovascular disease and generate new knowledge relevant to the identification of the environmental determinants of health. Establishing a robust econometric model for the health cost savings directly attributable to urban ecology would open new funding channels for our troubled urban ecosystems.  From the extensive data generated by the study, we will be able to delineate the contribution of the underlying psychological, behavioral, and biochemical mechanisms to the relationship between CVD and neighborhood greenness. The results of this project will also provide us a new understanding of how urban greenspaces affect neighborhood livability, community cohesion, economic activity and geographic resilience.\r\n\r\nPartners:  \r\nMeera Bhat \u2013 Dir., The Nature Conservancy NA Cities Program, study design\r\nPascal Mittermaier \u2013 Dir., The Nature Conservancy Global Cities Program, fundraising\r\nBill Toomey \u2013 Dir., The Nature Conservancy Healthy Trees, Healthy Cities Program, community outreach\r\nChris Chandler \u2013 Dir., The Nature Conservancy Cites Program Kentucky Chapter, project manager\r\nDr. Ted Smith \u2013 Dir., Institute for Healthy Air Water and Soil, Louisville Chief of Innovation, study design\r\nDr. Aruni Bhatnagar \u2013 Dir., Diabetes and Obesity Center, University of Louisville, clinical study design\r\nBrent Bucknam \u2013 Principal Hyphae Labs & Urban Biofilter, Oakland, California, vegetation design\r\nMaria Koetter \u2013Dir. of Sustainability, City of Louisville, study design \r\nMrs. Christina Lee Brown \u2013 Philanthropist, study design\r\nDr. Jay Turner \u2013 Associate Professor & Director of Undergraduate Programs, air quality specialist\r\nFunding: \r\nTo address the health and greening problem quickly, we will need more resources than local government and a single foundation funding source can provide.

      "ProjectId":1066,"Name":"Michigan Saginaw Bay","BriefDescription":"Michigan Saginaw Bay","LongDescription":"Saginaw Bay is an ecologically significant and highly productive embayment of Lake Huron, supporting a diversity of fish, waterfowl, and other wildlife; Saginaw Bay has the \u201clargest concentration of coastal wetlands in the Lake Huron Basin\u201d and serves as Lake Huron\u2019s most important source for several fish species, including walleye (Liskauskas et al. 2007). The <i>Saginaw Bay watershed</i> is the largest in the state of Michigan, spanning 5.5 million acres and covering parts of 22 counties. The ecological health of Saginaw Bay and its tributaries is critically important to not only Lake Huron, but the entire Great Lakes ecosystem, as this watershed provides vital ecosystem services for both nature and people, including fish spawning habitat and abundant farmland.<br /><br />Saginaw Bay was designated as a Great Lakes Area of Concern (AOC) in 1995, threatened by high sediment and phosphorus contributions from tributaries, contaminated sediment and loss of wetlands (Public Sector Consultants, Inc. 2002). At the time of its designation, Saginaw River and Bay had 12 of a possible 14 beneficial use impairments (BUIs).<br /><br />Although there is widespread awareness about the role sediments and nutrients play in diminishing the health of Saginaw Bay, these problems persist. One significant source of excessive sediment and nutrient loading is through agricultural activity, which has well-documented impacts on aquatic systems (Blann et al. 2009) and is widespread in the Saginaw Bay watershed. Collectively, the 22 counties that are wholly or partially encompassed by the Saginaw Bay Watershed account for 45% of Michigan\u2019s agricultural land (MUCC 1993).<br /><br />In the fall 2012, as part of The Nature Conservancy in Michigan\u2019s strategic planning process, the Saginaw Bay watershed was identified as one of 13 geographic conservation priority areas throughout the state. The Conservancy has had a long-standing presence in this region, especially in the Shiawassee River watershed, where on-the-ground staff has worked to target agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) to improve aquatic habitat and restore wetlands in the Shiawassee Flats area. While TNC is not doing active restoration in the Saginaw Bay watershed at this time, it is employing traditional conservation strategies and testing new tools to achieve targeted, outcome-based conservation that will benefit people and nature. The work being done in Saginaw Bay is also included as part of the Agriculture and Altered Hydrology strategy of the Great Lakes Project and is one of the three most significant bay areas in the Great Lakes basin (the other two are Green Bay and Maumee Bay).","StartDate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00-06:00","EndDate":null,"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null,"Status":"Idea","Accomplishments":[

The focus of the CBP is on strategic plan themes of land protection and management to address pervasive threats to the habitat, leveraging public funding and our agency partners\u2019 conservation efforts and adapting to climate change. The CBP will serve as a guide to our conservation investments over the next five years and will inform our role in the new global campaign and the next iteration of the Chapter strategic plan.The grassland conservation program will deploy three primary strategies\u2014protection, ecological management, and collaboration\u2014to improve and sustain functioning grassland systems across our grassland portfolio sites. The program focus is on 12 priority landscapes totaling 2.4 million acres, with outcomes of maintaining grassland cover and continuity, improving condition of grasslands, and sustaining a ranching culture in our priority landscapes. Grasslands of the Great Plains are threatened by a number of forces, such as conversion to row-crop agriculture, ecologically inappropriate disturbance practices, invasive species and climate change. Applying broad-scale and complementary strategies to protect the extent and improve the condition of native grasslands on private lands is the key to protecting and sustaining our remaining prairie ecosystems.Our theory of change is that through strategic use of our existing land and staff assets, building new capacity for protection and management on private lands and exploring new models for sustaining the economics of private ranching, we will leverage conservation at scale on private lands in our priority grassland landscapes. To accomplish this change, we will:PROTECT the integrity of native grassland ecosystems through targeted and accelerated use of easements and fee acquisition of land.TRANSFORM the scale and impact of our partners\u2019 work through collaborative planning and by leveraging public funding.INSPIRE landowners to adopt new grassland management practices using our preserves as demonstration platforms.Protection: A central theme of our program is the permanent protection of grasslands, one of the most threatened habitats in the world with the objective of protecting an additional 46,400 acres within our priority landscapes across all three states (Mgmt A). Our primary protection tools include selective fee-title acquisition by the Conservancy and assisting our partners in acquiring conservation easements on private lands. We will expand the use of Conservancy employed Conservation Easement Technicians embedded in partner offices to accelerate the implementation of federally funded easement programs. Success depends on securing sufficient public and private funding through strategic collaborations (Finance A) and innovative market-based approaches. Over the next five years we will begin implementing a carbon credit easement program in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to create a revolving fund of conservation dollars that leverage and accelerate existing easement programs. The amount of grass cover is largely influenced by policy work in conjunction with our partners, such as Farm Bill and federal and state easement programs. Our goal is to reduce the loss of grasslands within our priority landscapes (Policy A).4Ecological Management: Condition matters. In addition to \u201ckeeping the green side up,\u201d we strive to improve the ecological health of grasslands. With a focus on Nature Conservancy and private ranching lands, we will accelerate the use of critical management tools like prescribed fire (Mgmt B) and conservation grazing to \u201cmove the conservation needle.\u201d We also envision a central role for our preserves and partners\u2019 lands in helping define \u201csustainable grazing,\u201d potentially as a component of a larger sustainable beef strategy. We will gage our success by the degree to which native-dominated plant communities increase on actively managed Conservancy preserves, striving for 5% (Eco A). We will leverage our preserves as demonstrations to facilitate ecologically beneficial management techniques on private lands. This outcome will be achieved through direct action on neighboring private lands and by convening workshops and other learning opportunities for landowners within our priority geographies (People B).Collaboration: The ambitious targets for protection and ecological management laid out above will only be possible through strong collaboration with agency partners and private ranchers/ranching associations. We will expand the Conservancy\u2019s capacity to participate and lead on collaborative processes that leverage our traditional work by influencing partners, providing resources, and capitalizing on TNC subject matter expertise. Further, we will work directly with private landowners within priority geographies to enhance conservation outcomes on private lands and help maintain a ranching culture (People A). We will also strengthen our collaboration within the Conservancy and with private producers through participation in the Grasslands Conservation Network.Finance and Capacity: The Grassland program constitutes approximately 70% of the Chapter\u2019s overall budget, or ~$7.5 million, consistent with the distribution of grasslands across our three states, and including the majority of the Conservancy\u2019s preserve acreage and nearly 40 FTEs in FY2015. To achieve the conservation outcomes called for in the plan requires moderate to aggressive growth of the Program to a total budget of about $18.5 million by FY2018, primarily through increased field capacity for work on private lands and funds for additional protection. The plan assumes that current levels of baseline funding and staffing will remain in place, while increasing our impact at the landscape scale requires new resources and new investment, most significantly in increased seasonal field crews, new easement technicians and grazing infrastructure for key preserves. Most of this new investment (75-80%) is projected to come from public funding sources, market-based strategies, and by leveraging existing partner programs to the landscapes we care most about. To leverage an estimated $30-50 million in public funds for protection we expect to need $3-3.5 million in private revenue.","StartDate":"2014-12-15T00:00:00-07:00","EndDate":null,"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null,"Status":"Idea","Accomplishments":[

Whilst economic growth has been steadily increasing in the last decade, the country\u2019s social and environmental capital is highly threatened. The Magdalena River, historically the most important waterway of the country and its entire basin, where almost 80% of the Colombian population settles, is under unprecedented pressure. The development of traditional economic activities such as mining, oil extraction, hydropower generation and agriculture with no social and environmental considerations threatens the future and wellbeing of more than 32 million people and the conservation of such a culturally rich and biologically diverse region of the world.The Nature Conservancy is uniquely positioned to address the challenge of bringing together the wide range of stakeholders from the public and private sectors to civil society within the basin and to provide our technical expertise for the sustainable management of the Magdalena River Basin. Over the past six decades, the Conservancy has evolved into a leading voice in freshwater conservation, investing in more than 500 freshwater projects worldwide. Our work encompasses whole ecological systems and involves a wide array of partners such as government agencies, leading water users, managers and energy developers. We are implementing complex strategies across the Mississippi, Colorado, Penobscot, Yangtze, Zambezi and many other river basins, as well as furthering freshwater research and policies at around the world.Plan ContextThis conservation business plan is primarily intended to bring together all the aspects of working in a dynamic, multi-cultural, and economically important watershed under a common vision for the future. It is intended to help the Magdalena team coordinate their work under that vision and articulate TNC\u2019s unique role in integrated management of the basin. As such, the primary audience is TNC\u2019s Magdalena team itself. The document will also serve as the foundation for all future work, and as a basis for determining our role in future opportunities in the watershed. The document will also serve as a foundation for future outreach, marketing and philanthropic materials, and essentially serve as the foundation through which we \u201ctell the story\u201d of our work in the Magdalena.While the primary audience is the Magdalena Team, this document also serves to summarize the Magdalena project within the context of the global challenges and global solutions that frame TNC\u2019s work globally. As such, this plan is targeted to other audiences within TNC (Great Rivers Partnership, the Executive Team, etc.), donors who know us well, and our trustees and Board of Directors.","StartDate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","EndDate":null,"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null,"Status":"Idea","Accomplishments":[

Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Timor Leste, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands came together to launch the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security (CTI-CFF). CTI-CFF is a regional, multi-nation coalition that the Conservancy helped inspire and launch, and provides a platform for regional-level collaborative, coordinated, cost-effective conservation. Through this Initiative, the Conservancy is working with communal landowners, fishermen, and governments to:\r\n\r\n1.\tTo protect the region?s most productive coastlines and reefs through a combination of cutting-edge science, protected area design, policy and legal frameworks.\r\n2.\tEnsure sustainable harvests through effective management of coral reefs, fisheries and other natural systems that sustain the lives of people around the world.\r\n3.\tAddress climate change threats by designing and implementing ecosystem-based adaptation strategies to protect the communities themselves and the natural resources they depend on for shelter and sustenance.\r\n4.\tBuild a constituency for conservation by identifying and investing in local champions through educational and social marketing campaigns, technical training and support to peer and learning networks and, in turn, creating broad social movements for conservation. \r\n5.\tPioneer new approaches to conservation. We are sparking change with innovations in climate change adaptation, sustainable finance, and through new groundbreaking partnerships which have the potential to revolutionize  and multiply the impacts of our conservation work across broad geographies.","StartDate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","EndDate":null,"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null,"Status":"Idea","Accomplishments":[

      "ProjectId":492,"Name":"Upper Mississippi River","BriefDescription":"We are Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri working collaboratively to create conservation solutions at a whole-systems scale.  We are committed to reducing nutrients flowing into the Gulf of Mexico and protecting and restoring the northern headwaters of the mighty Mississippi River.","LongDescription":"Our documents can be found on Connect, Upper Mississippi River.  \r\n\r\nLook for org chart on Connect too.\r\n\r\nStrategic Plan\r\n\r\nSituation Analysis\r\nThe Mississippi River Basin has emerged as a priority at the global and regional levels of The Nature Conservancy. It has been an historic focus of our North America (NA) Freshwater Team and many basin states have important projects underway as well.  Now that the Global Challenges Global Solutions framework has been adopted and whole systems work is being incorporated into US divisions, the Central Division has assumed responsibility for the Mississippi River system and its associated sub-basins. \r\nA tradition of independent Chapter approaches has served The Conservancy well when working at spatial scales smaller than most of the recently identified whole system priorities.  However, realizing the full potential of this investment at this scale will require strong internal collaboration, shared leadership and alignment among state chapters as well as other invested operating units throughout The Conservancy (North America Policy and Practice teams, World Wide Office and Global).   \r\n\r\nWhy Significant: \r\n\r\nThe Mississippi River basin is the third largest watershed in the world, draining 41% of the continental U.S.  It is the most biologically diverse temperate river system in the world, hosting globally significant natural diversity \u2013 including over 400 species of native freshwater fishes representing half of the diversity in the U.S.  Its rich lands and waters fuel one of the world\u2019s largest bird migrations \u2013 a highway connecting life from the arctic to South America. Similarly, the Mississippi River basin serves as an important transportation corridor and a globally significant agricultural landscape for people in the basin and around the world. This economic engine is not boundless, however.  Economic growth has led to significant environmental degradation, affecting not only nature, but also the services it provides.  \r\n\r\nThe Upper Mississippi is the northern headwaters to the Mississippi. Here, river flows have dramatically changed as a result of:\r\n\u2022\tThe severing of floodplains from the mainstem and tributaries \u2013 resulting in a loss of water holding capacity and subsequently increased water flows and flooding downstream.\r\n\u2022\tDirect impacts to river flows by transportation related infrastructure (locks and dams). \r\n\u2022\tConversion of over 60% of the land has reduced the infiltration of precipitation and subsequently significantly modifying the hydrology of streams and rivers within the watershed.  This in turn is also contributing to water quality deterioration and nutrient loading downstream. \r\n\r\nHowever, considerable forested watersheds remain intact that provide essential functions and benefits to the Basin\u2019s 72 million residents, notably, the provision of clean and reliable drinking water and predictable river flows.  Yet much of this natural capital is unsecured and under threat from development and new agricultural conversion, and water availability for cities is challenged by poor agricultural practices and the effects of a changing climate.  \r\n\r\nChallenges, Drivers and Opportunities\r\n\r\nThe approaches and underlying concepts that have been applied to the management of the Mississippi River and its tributaries evolved within a somewhat different economic, political and social context.  The intent was to \u201ctame\u201d and \u201cmanage\u201d the river and the economic resources to support the effort were available.  Today, there are a number of vested interests in maintaining the status quo.  However, over the last 150 years we have come to a better understanding of the consequences of those management approaches, and are now beginning to realize they have created as many problems as they have purported to solve.  Additionally, the combination of climate change and a significant reduction in the economic resources needed to update and maintain the current infrastructure has created an opening where new \u201cgreener\u201d and more economically viable and integrated approaches to river management can be considered.\r\n\r\nPoor floodplain management and policies: The challenge is to change floodplain management approaches at a meaningful scale in a profitable agricultural landscape. Demonstrating approaches to address the needs of landowners, flood risk reduction, and environmental health will provide the opportunity to develop markets for floodplain services and improve policy on floodplain management.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure: The challenge is to integrate policies in support of alternative designs and operations, and  include more green infrastructure as a viable alternative  to enhance river hydraulics and hydrology, fish and wildlife habitat, and  lower flood risk all while  providing a secure transportation corridor. The opportunity is an aging water resources (Army Corps) infrastructure in urgent need of upgrade. \r\n \r\nCities, agriculture, water quality and the Gulf of Mexico: The challenge includes a growing population that will require clean water for drinking and industrial purposes and the demand on agriculture to produce more products for food and fuel while reducing its impact on the environment. The opportunities include:\r\n\u2022\tRegulatory requirements to meet water quality standards and the Hypoxia Task Force goals will bring diverse partners together to meet standards. \r\n\u2022\tCities, with growing populations and recent water quality and supply concerns, present an opportunity to engage population centers with larger watershed management.\r\n\u2022\tMarket forces driven by the calls for sustainable products.\r\n\u2022\tFarm Bill targeting of funds to Mississippi watershed. \r\n\r\nTheory of Change: \r\nThe Mississippi River Basin has gone through significant habitat alteration, structural development, and management practices that have affected its ability to function naturally and provide services to society. Current agricultural practices, an aging water infrastructure and management approaches cannot adequately address the increasing needs and the risks posed by climate change projections. The remaining natural components of the river basin and those that have been transformed but not eliminated have generally not been considered in the past to be part of the solutions, and have in some cases been seen as the problem.  However, they can contribute significantly to the multiple needs of society and nature with cheaper and longer-lasting results through protection, restoration, and alternative management approaches at appropriate scales.\r\n\r\nRecent record-\u00ad\u2010setting floods and droughts, and forecasts for more frequent extreme weather events are stimulating national debates on agricultural and water policy through the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) and Farm Bill, and a consumer-based market to drive changes in corporate supply chain practices.  Ensuring that these policies and practices are improved and implemented to address the needs of a healthy river system and services it provides to society is critical to addressing the issues at appropriate scales.  If policies and practices are adequately structured and implemented, nature would benefit and provide great value to multiple stakeholders and sectors that rely on and are affected by the management of the river basin resources.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAt the UMR whole system scale, we propose to address three thematic areas: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tResilient Floodplains \u2013 advancing approaches, policies, finance mechanisms and implementation to broadly protect and restore floodplains to lower flood risk and benefit fish, wildlife and recreation.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tRiver Infrastructure \u2013 incorporating and considering environmental sustainability in policies and management guidelines to lower long\u2010term costs and risks to people and nature.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tNutrient Reduction/Source Water Protection \u2013 testing new finance and policy drivers to support environmental sustainability practices in land management for clean and reliable water.\r\n\r\nScope:\r\nThe scope of this plan includes the five states at the northern headwaters of the river -Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nOverarching Goal:\r\n\r\nTo contribute to the restoration of ecosystem process in the headwaters of the MS River by collaboratively working across state lines to: \r\n1) Improve water quality and drinking water security. \r\n2) Develop new green approaches to transportation infrastructure. \r\n3) Restore floodplain structure and function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFloodplain Restoration\r\nContext\r\nFrom the 1880s through the 1920s, drainage and levee districts were organized along the Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries.  Their main purposes were to drain floodplain areas too wet for agriculture, and to protect such areas, as well as floodplains previously being farmed, from flooding.  Districts constructed levees, isolating floodplains from the river and degrading many natural ecological functions. More recently, the increasing frequency and magnitude of flood events has damaged levees and stressed many of these districts financially.  Several districts have been acquired for conservation purposes in the past.  While fewer opportunities remain the availability of these has not been exhausted.\r\n\r\nOutcomes\r\n1.\tProtect and restore functional floodplain in natural and working landscapes by 2025. (moving toward an overall goal of approximately 50% of the floodplain with restored and protected functions associate with river \u2013 floodplain connection \u2013 need to double the current amount of 600,000 acres of protected/functional floodplain to reach the goal). \r\n2.\tRestore and/or protect 50,000 acres by 2017.  \r\nStrategy 1:  Impact Capital for Large Scale Floodplain Acquisition\r\nAssemble large contiguous blocks of floodplain land through an acquisition strategy with private investment capital that can be used in working lands model for floodplains or restored through traditional conservation programs.\r\nActivities \r\n1.\tConduct a real estate assessment that determines the availability of floodplain lands in the UMR and the average annual turnover in floodplain real estate.

The Upper Mississippi River navigation system currently includes 37 locks and dams on both river systems and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divided into three districts, St. Paul, Rock Island and St. Louis. \r\nBeyond the modification to the mainstem of the UMR, an extensive number of large and small dams have been constructed on many of the river\u2019s major tributaries. Central among these is the system of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dams, operated for multiple purposes such as flood risk management, recreation, fish and wildlife, water supply, and hydropower. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) includes an approximately 130-mile array of natural rivers, canals, locks and other structures in Chicago and northwest Indiana. Constructed beginning in the 1890s, the waterway system diverted polluted water away from the city\u2019s Lake Michigan drinking water source and created a connection across the mid-continental divide to the Mississippi watershed. The CAWS was a 19th century solution to a single problem. Pressure has been building to update this antiquated urban infrastructure from a number of fronts, one of which is as the primary dispersal pathway between the Great Lakes and Mississippi basins for aquatic invasive species. There are several opportunities that are presenting themselves simultaneously that bode well for modernizing the CAWS now, despite solutions that are in the billions of dollars. One is the extreme attention being paid to invasive Asian carp from the Mississippi knocking on the door of the Great Lakes at the CAWS.\r\nOutcomes\r\n1.\tTen Army Corps of Engineers dam operations will have greater flexibility to re-operate the dams for ecological purposes along with traditional use by 2020.\r\n2.\tA two-way ecological separation of Lake Michigan and Mississippi basins solution is agreed upon and fully funded by 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrategy 1: Ecological dam operation will be possible at three Army Corps dams.\r\n\r\nChange dam operation at three sites by working with managing agencies and federal policy to provide ecosystem benefits as well as original authorized purpose such as navigation, hydropower, and flood control.   \r\n\r\nActivities: \r\n1.\tComplete fourth demonstration drawdown to further understand the value of this restoration tool in the highly degraded conditions of Pool 3.  NAFW 2016 \r\n2.\tWork with partners and the Army Corps of Engineers to select the best pool to revise the water control manual to include additional flexibility to make it easier to routinely implement drawdown. 2016 Template plan will serve as a model for revisions to other water control manuals.  NAFW 2017\r\n3.\tDetermine if Saylorville and Red Rock Dams on the Des Moines River in Iowa can be operated to improve environmental flows and reduce high nutrient loading under the Sustainable River Program (SRP) by 2015.  \r\n4.\tWork with Rock Island District to include any potential changes in the updated water control manual. 2016 NAFW/Iowa\r\n\r\nStrategy 2: Two way separation of Mississippi River and Great Lakes basin\r\n\r\nAdvocate with Congress and the Army Corps of Engineers for legislative and administrative measures/funding to put in place infrastructure changes resulting in the two-way, ecological separation of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basins.\r\n\r\nActivities: \r\n\r\n1.\tWork in conjunction with the Great Lakes Project (GLP) to identify and educate members of congressional delegations to support interim legislative/administrative provisions that begin the process of ecological separation. State GR/Marketing 2016\r\n2.\tEnsure that UMR Program invasive concerns/priorities/perspectives are integrated into CAWS messaging to Congress and Corps. State GR /Marketing  2015\r\n3.\tProvide staff resources to work with strategic Chicago partners and TNC Great Lakes Program to obtain agreements, authorization and funding to restore ecological separation of the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS).  Illinois 2017\r\n\r\nSource Water Protection/Nutrient Reduction\r\nContext  \r\nNutrient loading from both agricultural and developed landscapes continues to impact water quality at all scales of the Mississippi River Basin.  In addition, nutrient loading from the Mississippi has a significant impact on the size and intensity of the zone of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico.  In order to improve the aquatic habitats within the basin as well as minimize the nutrient load to the Gulf, Mississippi River States have/are establishing quantitative nutrient reduction goals and implementation plans to achieve those goals \u2013 in alignment with the EPA Gulf Hypoxia goals. (Agricultural sources contribute approximately 70% and urban sources another 9-12%)  \r\n\u2022\tMunicipalities and water treatment facilities will be required to meet the nutrient reduction requirements as point sources. They will pursue low cost alternatives including green infrastructure and nutrient trading opportunities. Some corporations have expressed participating in source water protection for the benefit of nature and people. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tGreater emphasis will be placed on targeting the implementation of non-point/ag treatment practices to meet states nutrient reduction goals. State and federal funding will be prioritized based on outcomes, targets and collaboration. (Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds)\r\nOutcomes\r\nReverse the trends of gulf hypoxia expansion and inland water quality degradation by restoring the natural processes that reduce, trap and remove nutrient-laden drainage from agricultural watersheds.  Nitrate and phosphorus delivery to the Mississippi River by the five Upper Mississippi states is reduced by 25% by 2034\r\n\r\nStrategy 1:  Increase Water security\r\n\r\nPartner with cities and corporate sponsors in four UMR states to develop new approaches to increase water security including investing in green infrastructure, increased efficiency of water use, nutrient reduction and/or disaster risk reduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities\r\n\r\n1.\tEstablish water funds for cities, industry and corporations by engaging with them to define and create the appropriate market mechanisms. Advance projects in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois.   NAFW/States 2016\r\n2.\tDirect protection and restoration activities to portions of watersheds where they serve multiple resource benefit for nature and people. Emphasis is placed on protecting watershed attributes contributing toward watershed health and critical areas where restoration serves multiple long-term benefits. States 2017\r\na.\tMonitor outcomes at each project. NAFW/States 2017\r\n3.\tEngage appropriate partners at the front end of each project that will effectively inform the policy framework guiding water infrastructure investments, and water quality and quantity performance standards made by governments first in the UMR, the nation, and relevant private sectors. States/GR/UMR 2015 \r\n4.\tImplement conservation practices using existing and new delivery mechanisms at our projects and help direct these funds to other water fund projects. (farm bill, EPA Clean Water Act and state resources) Primary leverage via participation on NRCS State Technical Committee. NAAG/ States 2018\r\n\r\nStrategy 2: Precision Conservation\r\nTarget and improve farm practices to reduce nutrient loading into receiving streams and waterways in priority watersheds using a private/public partnership. \r\nActivities \r\n1.\tEngage USDA conservation programs to help states carry out their nutrient reduction plans by directing at least 20% of their water-quality funding to scientifically targeted management practices and riverine process restoration, with payments weighted toward performance. NAFW/States  2016\r\n2.\tWork with watershed partners to institutionalize an outcome based targeted approach to implementing conservation practices using Farm Bill, state and private resources. States 2015\r\n3.\tLeverage private and public partnerships and the technical and financial resources they provide to secure large funding sources and implement basin scale strategies. NAAG/States/UMR 2017 \r\n4.\tPartner with influential corporations to develop and implement new delivery systems that mobilize their customer service network to implement conservation practices. NAAG/States 2016\t\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning\r\nContext\r\nWhole systems are well designed to offer professional growth opportunities and to facilitate information exchange between participating OU\u2019s and between other whole systems. \r\nOutcome\r\nStaff exchange best practices, problem solve, learn and export successful or new ideas. Staff is motivated and effective and has new professional opportunities.  Trustees are engaged and providing valuable feedback.\r\nStrategy 1-Knowledge Transfer\r\nActivities\r\n1.\tLearn what the team needs related to learning and implement.  Develop clear deliverables. UMR 2015\r\n2.\tHost one annual meeting designed to exchange ideas, problem solve, stay connected to the whole system and to the whole Mississippi River.

TNC will implement that vision in a focal group of countries responsible for over half of global supply of corn, soy, sugar cane and beef, and over a third of global supply of rice, wheat and potatoes. Building out from established centres of strength in the US and Brazil, we will deepen the Conservancy's engagement with agriculture in China, Africa, Indonesia, Colombia, Argentina, Australia and Canada. There is no simple way to define agricultural sustainability, but we will seek to encourage agricultural systems at all scales that are resilient, conserve soils and water, use inputs efficiently and integrate natural habitat into farms and ranches.","StartDate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","EndDate":null,"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null,"Status":"Idea","Accomplishments":[

      "ProjectId":295,"Name":"Oregon Forests","BriefDescription":"Achieve 13 million acres of resilient forests, including 6.5 million acres restored and managed with periodic fire, via collaborative forest forums, demonstrating ecologically based forest restoration, modifying agency policies and programs, and developing innovative restoration funding mechanisms","LongDescription":"THE CASE FOR ACTIONForests cover nearly 50 percent of Oregon, and nearly half of these forested landscapes are ponderosa pine and dry, mixed-conifer forests that historically persisted under frequent wildfires of varying size, severity and frequency. The ponderosa pine forests at low to mid elevation in eastern and southwest Oregon experienced low severity fires every three to ten years. Mixed conifer forests historically dominated by ponderosa pine, Douglas fir and sugar pine at higher elevations and north facing slopes adapted to a more varied fire regime that included low and high severity fires across the landscape every seven to 25 years. Collectively, fire events both large and small maintained the open structure and species composition of these \u201cfrequent-fire\u201d forests in Oregon, and throughout the West.Fourteen million acres of ponderosa pine and dry, mixed-conifer forests span seven National Forests and two Bureau of Land Management districts in Oregon. The ecological condition and health of these forested landscapes affects populations of over 800 forest-dependent species, including imperiled white-headed woodpeckers, northern goshawks, northern spotted owl, and Pacific fisher (pers. comm. Steve Buttrick). The freshwater systems embedded within these forests also support an array of biodiversity, including threatened bull trout, redband trout, Oregon spotted frogs, yellow rails, endemic freshwater mollusks, Chinook and coho salmon, and steelhead.Over the past 100 years, forest management on public lands has altered forest structure and composition, and federal and state fire suppression policies have disrupted the natural fire cycles across the West. Today in Oregon, 9.4 million acres of frequent-fire forests are moderately or highly departed from historic condition. The exclusion of periodic, low-intensity fires, plus the effects of timber harvesting, has altered the structure and composition of forests, creating higher, more uniform stocking densities, increased fuel loads, and a higher proportion of shade-tolerant species.These conditions have heightened the risk and susceptibility of these forests to uncharacteristically large, intense wildfires, in addition to disease, insect outbreaks and drought. As a result, over the past 40 years both the number of fires and the average size of large wildfires on Forest Service lands nationally has increased dramatically (Fig. 1), and concurrently the number of acres burned and associated fire suppression costs have risen sharply (Fig. 2). Going forward, climate change and the anticipated temperature rise and lengthened summers will further increase the likelihood of uncharacteristic wildfires and outbreaks of insects and disease in the future. To address this problem, we must increase the rate of forest restoration on our public lands by 300 percent in the next decade, or face consequences of falling even further behind.While the risk to the health of our frequent fire forests are increasing, Oregon\u2019s forest products infrastructure and a trained work force to implement restoration actions are declining and rural communities are in economic distress. In the past, distrust among key stakeholders was a nearly insurmountable barrier to action. Over the past 10 years, trust has started to re-build and consensus is emerging among diverse stakeholders on how to restore these forested landscapes. Strategies are gaining traction, and leadership from Governor Kitzhaber, our congressional delegation, the state legislature, industry and conservation groups are uniquely aligned. By acting now we can restore the health of our forests and provide timely benefits to people through protection of rural communities, recreation opportunities and municipal drinking water while concurrently increasing delivery of wood products to local mills, helping to abate high unemployment in Oregon\u2019s rural timber dependent Counties.The Conservancy brings knowledge to develop ecologically based treatments, boots on the ground in key landscapes, relationships across diverse stakeholders, and an ecological understanding of the scope and scale of the problem. We take a reasoned approach and commitment to work with, support and lead collaborative efforts, and are recognized by partners and stakeholders as a neutral broker. With colleagues from across the state and country we can translate success on the ground into new state and federal policies, programs and increased funding.Restoring frequent-fire forests is one of seven priority Initiatives in the Oregon Chapter\u2019s 2012-2016 Strategic Plan. The purpose of the Forest Business Plan is to define a long-term vision for success, lay out a five-year action plan and the outcomes we hope to achieve, and identify resources needed to restore Oregon\u2019s forests. This initiative will support and be supported by The Nature Conservancy\u2019s North America Forest Priority and contribute to whole-system conservation in the Upper Deschutes, Klamath and Rogue River basins.","StartDate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","EndDate":null,"Latitude":null,"Longitude":null,"Status":"Idea","Accomplishments":[
